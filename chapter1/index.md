In this chapter, we'll cover some of the basic things that make up a Java program. First, we'll talk about **Classes**. Then, we'll take a look at **Functions** and the special **Main Function**. Finally, we'll look at the basic **Data Types**, **Variables** and **Operators** that Java makes available to us.

<!-- Testing that Java and the IDE is working. Will be migrated to Chapter0 when that is completed. -->

This chapter assumes you have a working **JDK** and **IDE**. To make sure that this is working, we can write a program that prints out a message:

```Java
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```
*[HelloWorld.java](./HelloWorld.java)*

Then run the program using your IDE's Run button. You may need to build the project before you run it, depending on which IDE you are using. We will be discussing each piece of this program during this chapter, so don't worry if you don't understand it yet.
