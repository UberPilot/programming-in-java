## Definitions:

**Content Article**: An article that is focused on teaching a concept. Content articles are the main body of the chapter, while non-content articles such as indices, reviews, and exercises are there to reinforce the body.

# Contributing:

We accept corrections and new submissions for tutorials. For these, we use Pull Requests. For more information on Pull Requests, please read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). 

## Code Corrections:

If the code in a tutorial will not compile or has an error, feel free to submit a code correction. Please include a clear list of what you've done, and link the issue (or create one) that is fixed in the pull request ([see here](https://blog.github.com/2013-05-14-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/)) or in the commit. Make sure that your commits are atomic (one issue/feature per commit).

Example commit message:
```
$ git commit -m "Fixes #0
>
> Add missing semicolon."
```

## Language Corrections:

If the language in a tutorial is confusing or in improper english, feel free to submit a language correction. Please include a clear list of what the issues you saw were (create an issue!), and how you fixed them. Make sure that your commits are atomic (one article per commit).

Example commit message:
```
$ git commit -m "Fixes #0
>
> Convert confusing sentence structure to parallel sentence structure."
```

## Tutorial Articles:

All tutorials follow this same template:

```md

Each article should include examples for what is being illustrated, both with a real-world explanation and code samples, if applicable. Each content article should also be finished with a Review section in which the content that has been outlined is summarized. Please read through a few of the articles that already exist to get the hang of it.
