<h1 align='center'>Programming in Java</h1>
<p align='center'><em>Written by UberPilot</em></p>

This is a set of documents that explain Java concepts, starting with basics such as Classes, Methods, and Variables, and moving on to more advanced things such as the Standard Library, Generics, and Recursion. This will be updated as frequently as I am available to write, and is not yet finished. Items that are in a finished state will be clickable in the table of contents, although more will be accessible in the repository directory.

This tutorial mainly covers what is present in Java 8, although it is possible that other versions will be covered as they become the stable version. These articles will have a note at the top of the page denoting what version they are using.
