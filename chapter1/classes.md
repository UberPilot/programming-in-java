### Classes

Everything in Java is or stems from a **Class**. The keyword `class` appears near the top of every Java file. Programs written in Java start with, and are made up of classes. In the code that was used to test your IDE, a class was clearly used:

```java
public class HelloWorld
```
Classes are more than just a statement that we need to put at the top of every file. They are containers for **Objects**, whether those are something real (Dogs) or just a concept that exists in our program (HelloWorld).

Classes are also responsible for two things. The first is storing data, called **State**. In our Dog example, state would include Name, Breed, Age, and Color. The second is operating on data they either store or receive, called **Behavior**. In our Dog example, behavior would include Barking, Eating, Sleeping, and Fetching. Classes are not required to have both state and behavior.

| State | Behavior |
|:------|:---------|
| Name  | Bark     |
| Breed | Eat      |
| Age   | Sleep    |
| Color | Fetch    |

### Instances and Classes

It is important to note that there is a difference between a Class and an **Instance** of a class. Classes are created to represent an object, but they are just a blueprint for that object. If we were to create a class Dog, it would not specifically represent one dog, Fido, but would also be a blueprint to represent another dog, Addie, as well.

### Review

Classes represent everything in Java. They store state, and have behavior that they can act on. Classes are blueprints that represent something, and instances are specific things that that blueprint represents.
