Java is one of the most popular programming languages used today. Java was released in 1995, and has since acquired more than 9 million developers. Java code is intended to be written once, but run anywhere. It runs on all types of devices, from computers to DVRs and parking meters.

So why learn Java? As one of the most popular programming languages, many opportunities are available for those who learn the language. If you want to contribute to open source software, Java is the third most popular language on GitHub<a href="#popSource"><sup>1</sup></a>. If your drive is monetary, Java is consistently one of the best-salaried languages and one of the most consistently in-demand<a href="#demandSource"><sup>2</sup></a>. If your desire is to learn to program in general, Java is a good mix between power and simplicity, without the complex pointers of other similar languages but with much of the same power and support for object-oriented development. 

Java also has one of the largest collections of libraries available. If you have a goal in mind, there is likely a library or framework available will make accomplishing that goal easier by reusing others' code. Web scraping, serialization, file parsing, API reading, and servers are all available through well-used and developed libraries online. In some cases, there are multiple choices depending on your needs.
